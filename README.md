Repository Purpose:
This repository contains all of my Python projects, including what is finished, what is being worked on, and what will be worked on.

Notice:
Some projects will have a "README" file if what the project does cannot be realized through the name.
Most projects will not be updated after being posted.

Personal Formatting:
At the end of sentences when printing out text to the terminal, periods will not be used unless there is a sentence after.
There will always be periods when it is a docstring. 
Docstrings, READMEs (except this one), Git commits, and comments will not use proper grammar and will be in half sentences. For example, "Running late, will be there soon." For a sentence to be complete, there has to be a noun and a verb. In the example, there is no noun.
Docstrings may leave out parts of what the code does to favor a general summary.

WARNING:
This repository contains content that only works on macOS.
