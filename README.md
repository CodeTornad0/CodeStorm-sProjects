This repository contains all of my Python projects including what is finished, what is being worked on, and what will be worked on.

Some projects will have a "README" file if what the project does cannot be realized through the name.
Most projects will not be updated after being posted.

At the end of sentences when printing out text, periods will not be used unless there is a sentence after.
There will always be periods when it is a docstring. 
Docstrings, READMEs (except this one), and comments will not use proper grammar and will be in half sentences. For example, "Running late, will be there soon." For a sentence to be complete, there has to a noun and a verb. In the example, there is no noun.
Docstrings may leave out parts of what the code does to favor a general summary. They will always be very brief.
